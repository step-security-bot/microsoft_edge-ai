**Evaluation Framework definition:**

```markdown
**Evaluation Framework:** Each capability is evaluated across four dimensions using a 0-10 scale:

- **Technical Fit (TF):** How well the capability matches scenario requirements

- **Implementation Practicality (IP):** Ease of implementation and resource requirements
- **Platform Cohesion (PC):** Integration benefits and cross-capability synergies
```

**Implementation Phases definition:**

```markdown
**Implementation Phases:** Capabilities are organized into four implementation phases:

- **PoC Phase (2-4 weeks):** Foundation capabilities for proof of concept
- **PoV Phase (6-12 weeks):** Value demonstration and business validation
- **Production Phase (3-6 months):** Operational deployment and integration
- **Scale Phase (6-18 months):** Enterprise transformation and optimization
```

## Business Value Expression Standards

### Prohibited Language - STRICT POLICY

**NEVER use monetary values, cost estimates, or financial projections:**

- Dollar amounts (e.g., "$50,000 savings", "$1M investment")
- Revenue projections (e.g., "increase revenue by 20%")
- Cost savings (e.g., "reduce costs by $100,000")

- Investment ranges with dollar amounts
- Budget requirements or estimates
- Financial ROI percentages with monetary context

**Always use resource intensity and performance metrics instead:**

- Resource intensity classifications (Low/Medium/High/Very High resource intensity)
- Operational efficiency (e.g., "50% faster defect detection")
- Quality improvements (e.g., "99.5% detection accuracy")
- Risk reduction (e.g., "80% reduction in safety incidents")
- Process optimization (e.g., "30% improvement in throughput")
- Performance multipliers (e.g., "2.5x faster processing", "3x return within 12 months")

### Investment and ROI Section Standards

**For "Typical Investment Range" sections:**

- Use: "Low to medium resource intensity (customize based on scope)"
- Use: "High resource intensity (enterprise-grade deployment)"

**For "Your Investment" sections:**

- Use: "Low to medium resource intensity (fill in your planned resource allocation)"
- Use: "High resource intensity (fill in your planned Scale resource allocation)"
- Do NOT use: "$_______ (fill in your planned investment)"

**For ROI projections:**

- Use: "2.5x return within 12 months" or "180% within 9 months"
- Focus on efficiency gains, quality improvements, and performance multipliers
- Do NOT include any dollar-based ROI calculations

### Business Value Categories
