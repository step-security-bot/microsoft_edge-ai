SCENARIO README TEMPLATE - PROJECT PLANNING EDITION

This template helps teams create comprehensive README documentation for new scenario implementations. This README should be placed in the scenario's dedicated folder (e.g., `/docs/project-planning/scenarios/your-scenario-name/README.md`).

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS TEMPLATE:

## Purpose in Project Planning Context
- Provide clear navigation and orientation for scenario documentation
- Present implementation approach and resource organization
- Support developers and stakeholders in understanding scenario structure
- Enable quick access to key scenario information and resources

## Integration with Project Planning Framework
- Reference the main scenario description document
- Link to capability mappings and implementation guides
- Connect to related scenarios and dependencies
- Provide clear paths to technical implementation resources

## Markdown Formatting Requirements
- ALWAYS follow markdown linting rules from /.mega-linter.yml
- Headers must have a blank line before and after
- Use only `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered lists
- Lists must have blank lines before and after
- Code blocks must use triple backticks with language specified
- Tables must have proper headers and separator rows
- Line length maximum: 500 characters (headings: 80 characters)
- No trailing whitespace
- No duplicate headers at same level

## Content Quality Guidelines
- Target length: 800-1200 words total
- Focus on practical implementation guidance
- Emphasize resource organization and navigation
- Use clear, action-oriented language
- Highlight key decisions and trade-offs
- Include next steps and getting started guidance
- Balance overview with sufficient detail for decision-making

## Template Usage Instructions
- Replace ALL placeholder text in [brackets]
- Follow word count guidelines for each section
- Maintain practical, implementation-focused content
- Include cross-references to related documentation
- Provide clear navigation paths for different user personas
- Update links and references to match your scenario structure
- Remove these instructions when creating actual scenario README
- Ensure consistency with main scenario description document

1. Scenario Overview (150-200 words)
2. Implementation Approach (200-250 words)
3. Resource Organization (150-200 words)
4. Prerequisites & Dependencies (150-200 words)
