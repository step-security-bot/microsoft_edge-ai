## 📊 Scenario Overview

Quality Process Optimization Automation delivers automated quality control through computer vision, IoT sensors, and predictive analytics for real-time defect detection and process optimization. This approach provides consistent quality measurement, reduced inspection time, and proactive process adjustment compared to manual quality control processes.

The scenario combines computer vision for defect detection, IoT sensors for process monitoring, and predictive analytics that identify quality issues before they impact production. This results in reduced defect rates, improved product consistency, and optimized manufacturing processes, along with comprehensive quality traceability and compliance reporting.

**Use cases include defect detection on production lines, process parameter optimization, and quality compliance reporting** - particularly where consistent product quality, regulatory compliance, and manufacturing efficiency are critical business requirements.

This **phase-based approach** provides clear visibility into:

- **⏱️ Timeline**: Each phase has specific duration and focus areas
- **🎯 Priority**: Left-to-right flow shows implementation order within each phase
- **📈 Value**: Progressive value delivery from 15% to 95% quality improvement
- **🔄 Dependencies**: Each phase builds upon previous achievements

The visual progression makes it easy to understand **what gets built when** and **how capabilities connect** to deliver incremental business value.

> **Important**: Before implementing this scenario, review the prerequisites documentation for hardware, software, permissions, and system requirements.

## 🚀 Advanced Capability Extensions

These capabilities extend beyond the core Quality Process Optimization Automation scenario to enable advanced manufacturing intelligence applications.
