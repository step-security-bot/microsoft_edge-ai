## Overview

This guide shows you how to leverage GitHub Copilot and our specialized project planning prompt to accelerate your edge AI project planning process.

**📋 For comprehensive project planning overview, see the [Project Planning README][project-planning-readme] which includes:**

- Complete scenarios library with implementation examples
- Platform capabilities documentation and mapping
- Templates for custom scenario development
- Component acceleration using existing /src implementations
- Step-by-step planning methodology

**🎯 For hands-on learning, try the [Project Planning Katas][project-planning-katas] which provide:**

- Progressive practice exercises using the interactive project planner
- Real scenarios for predictive maintenance, quality optimization, and packaging efficiency
- Multi-scenario planning and integration techniques
- Enterprise-scale strategic planning methodologies

## Quick Start: AI-Powered Project Planning

### 1. Activate the Interactive Project Planner

In GitHub Copilot Chat, activate our specialized interactive project planner:

```text
@edge-ai-project-planner
```

The interactive project planner provides:

- **Guided Discovery**: Step-by-step requirements gathering with focused questions
- **Scenario Matching**: AI-powered analysis to identify the best scenarios for your project
- **Capability Mapping**: Automatic mapping of scenarios to platform capabilities
- **Documentation Generation**: Complete project documentation created and saved to `./.copilot-tracking/`

### 2. Interactive Project Requirements Gathering

The project planner will guide you through focused questions to understand your project:

```text
I have a manufacturing facility with packaging equipment that breaks down frequently, causing production delays and high maintenance costs. We want to implement predictive maintenance to prevent equipment failures before they occur.
```

**The planner will ask follow-up questions like:**

- What industry are you in?
- Are you looking for a pilot project or enterprise-wide implementation?
- What's your primary goal - improving quality, reducing costs, or increasing efficiency?

**Answer these questions to help the AI match your requirements to appropriate scenarios.**

### 3. Automatic Scenario Selection and Documentation Generation

The AI assistant will:

- **Scenario Analysis**: Present 1-3 recommended scenarios that match your requirements
- **Capability Mapping**: Automatically identify required platform capabilities and dependencies
- **Implementation Planning**: Create a phased roadmap with specific milestones
- **Complete Documentation**: Generate comprehensive project documentation in `./.copilot-tracking/project-plan-[timestamp]/`

**Documentation includes:**

- Project README with overview and implementation guide
- Detailed scenario documentation with prerequisites and capability mappings
- Implementation roadmap with phased deployment plan
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Example Planning Sessions

### Manufacturing Quality Control

**Initial Input:**

```text
@edge-ai-project-planner

I'm planning an edge AI project for automated quality control in our electronics manufacturing line. We want to detect defects in real-time during production and reduce manual inspection overhead by 80%.
```

**Planner Response:**

The project planner will ask focused questions about your manufacturing type, integration requirements, and implementation scope, then recommend the **Quality Process Optimization Automation** scenario with detailed capability mapping.

**Generated Documentation:** Complete project plan in `./.copilot-tracking/` with scenario documentation, prerequisites, and implementation roadmap.

### Predictive Maintenance

**Initial Input:**

```text
@edge-ai-project-planner

I need to implement predictive maintenance for our industrial equipment fleet. We have 200+ pieces of critical equipment causing 15% unplanned downtime. Goal is to reduce this to less than 5%.
```

**Planner Response:**

The project planner will gather details about your equipment types, existing sensor infrastructure, and compliance requirements, then recommend the **Predictive Maintenance** scenario with implementation phases.

**Generated Documentation:** Comprehensive 18-month implementation plan with capability requirements, skills development recommendations, and compliance considerations.

## Learning Path: From Beginner to Expert

### Practice with Hands-On Katas

Before planning your real project, practice with our [Project Planning Katas][project-planning-katas]:

1. **[01 - Basic Prompt Usage][kata-01-basic]** (30 min): Learn project planner fundamentals with predictive maintenance
2. **[02 - Comprehensive Two-Scenario][kata-02-comprehensive]** (35 min): Practice multi-scenario analysis and integration
3. **[03 - Advanced Strategic Planning][kata-03-advanced]** (50 min): Master enterprise-scale planning with complex scenarios

### From Kata to Real Project

The katas teach you to:

- Navigate the interactive project planner effectively
- Understand scenario selection and capability mapping
- Generate comprehensive project documentation
- Plan multi-scenario implementations strategically

Apply these skills to your actual Edge AI projects for faster, more effective planning.

## Advanced Planning Techniques

### Multi-Scenario Integration

Use the project planner for complex scenarios involving multiple use cases:

```text
@edge-ai-project-planner

I want to implement both Quality Process Optimization and Packaging Line Performance Optimization. Can you help me create an integrated implementation plan that identifies shared capabilities and optimizes implementation sequence?
```

**Expected Result**: Integrated implementation plan with shared capability optimization and coordinated deployment phases.

### Enterprise-Scale Planning

For complex multi-facility implementations:

```text
@edge-ai-project-planner

I'm architecting Edge AI transformation for a global manufacturing conglomerate with 12 facilities. We need predictive maintenance, quality optimization, and performance monitoring across diverse product lines with 24-month phased rollout.
```

**Expected Result**: Strategic implementation orchestration plan with governance framework, shared platform optimization, and progressive value delivery milestones.

### Capability Deep Dive

Get detailed analysis of specific capabilities:

```text
I'm particularly interested in the Cloud AI Platform capabilities. For my [specific use case], help me understand:

1. What specific AI/ML services I'll need
2. How to integrate with edge inference
3. Training data requirements and management
4. Model deployment and updating strategies
```

### Getting the Most Value from AI-Assisted Planning

#### Start with Clear Objectives

- Define specific business outcomes you want to achieve
- Identify measurable success criteria
- Understand your constraints and requirements

#### Use the Interactive Process
