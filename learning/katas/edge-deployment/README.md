## Real-World Application

These streamlined katas prepare you for:

- **Edge Platform Deployment**: Systematic deployment of complex edge systems
- **Infrastructure Management**: AI-assisted infrastructure as code practices
- **Deployment Automation**: Streamlined deployment workflows and troubleshooting
- **Production Operations**: Real-world edge deployment and maintenance

## Prerequisites

**For All Katas**:

- Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed and active
- Active GitHub Copilot subscription with chat functionality
- **Active Azure subscription** with Contributor or Owner role
- Azure CLI, Terraform, and Bicep installed and configured
- Basic understanding of cloud infrastructure concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools and Git

**For Kata 300 and Beyond** (Multi-Blueprint and Expert):

- Strong understanding of Terraform module composition and state management
- Experience with Azure resource dependencies and integration patterns
- Understanding of Kubernetes and container orchestration (Kata 400-405)
- Sufficient time availability:
  - Kata 300: 120 minutes, cleanup within 3 hours
  - Kata 400: 150 minutes, cleanup within 4 hours
  - Kata 405: 240 minutes, cleanup within 6 hours

**For Kata 405** (Legendary - Production Deployment):

- Production operations experience with incident response and SLA management
- Understanding of disaster recovery concepts (RPO/RTO, failover procedures)
- Familiarity with enterprise monitoring and alerting systems
- Substantial Azure quota for multi-region deployment

## Cost Considerations

> **💰 Important**: All edge deployment katas deploy real Azure resources that incur costs.

**Estimated Costs by Kata**:

- **Kata 100** (Deployment Basics): $20-35 USD for single blueprint deployment
- **Kata 100** (Resource Management): $25-50 USD for IoT Operations and edge resources
- **Kata 300** (GitOps CI/CD Pipeline): $30-50 USD for multi-environment CI/CD setup
- **Kata 300** (Multi-Blueprint Coordination): $40-60 USD for coordinated multi-blueprint deployment
- **Kata 400** (Enterprise Compliance): $30-50 USD for compliance validation resources
- **Kata 400** (Workload Orchestration): $50-100 USD for Kalypso control plane and multi-cluster setup
- **Kata 500** (Deployment Expert): $45-70 USD for multi-region DR infrastructure

**Cost Management Best Practices**:

- Set timers when deploying resources to track deployment duration
- Complete cleanup steps within recommended timeframes (see each kata for specific guidance)
- Verify all resources deleted using `az resource list --output table` after cleanup
- Set up Azure budget alerts to prevent unexpected costs
- Use [Azure Cost Management][azure-cost-management] to monitor spending in real-time
- Consider using smaller VM SKUs (Standard_D2s_v3 instead of D4s_v3) for cost-conscious learning

**Cleanup Priority by Kata**:

- **Kata 100-200**: Complete cleanup within 2-3 hours of deployment
- **Kata 300**: Complete cleanup within 3-4 hours of deployment
- **Kata 400-405**: Complete cleanup within 4-6 hours of deployment
- Always verify cleanup completion in Azure Portal - some resources (Arc, IoT Operations) may require manual deletion

## Difficulty-Based Numbering

Kata filenames use a difficulty-based numbering system:

- **100-200** prefix: Foundation (Difficulty 1-2) - Beginner-friendly with heavy scaffolding and explicit prompts
- **300** prefix: Intermediate (Difficulty 3) - Moderate scaffolding with decision frameworks and validation checkpoints
- **400** prefix: Expert (Difficulty 4) - Light scaffolding with evaluation matrices and compliance frameworks
- **405** prefix: Legendary (Difficulty 5) - Minimal scaffolding, outcome-focused for production expertise

This numbering helps you quickly identify kata complexity and select appropriate challenges for your skill level.
